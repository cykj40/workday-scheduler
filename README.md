# workday-scheduler

## Description-
```md
I have created a workday scheduler that allows users to save tasks by the hour. 
My application will run in the browser and it features continously updating 
html. I also used bootstrap css, css, fontawesome and jquery.
```

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## Build
I was given partial starter code for my HTML. I had to create the rows and time slots.
I was given the css. 
I used jquery to dynamically change the html. The page now continuosly 
updates the time and date so that it can properly keep track of your tasks. 
I used Font awesome for special icons (fa-save).
